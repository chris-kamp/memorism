# About

"Memorism" is a full-stack, full CRUD web app allowing users to create, review and share sets of flashcards, built using Ruby on Rails and React.

This was my first attempt at creating a full-stack application (so forgive some roughness around the edges). As well as learning to build a Rails API and access it from React to perform CRUD operations, I practiced making components "editable in place", and worked with several new tools and libraries including styled components and react-hook-form.

The live app can be accessed [here](https://memorism.herokuapp.com/).
